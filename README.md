# To-Do-List-with-Priority-Queue
This is a console-based To-Do List application written in C++ that uses a priority queue to manage tasks based on importance. You can add tasks, assign them priorities, complete top-priority tasks, and view both pending and completed task lists. All data is saved between sessions using simple file I/O.
